## Online Gaming

I have started playing Computer Games on my Dads Computer when I was about 5 and I have been interested in Games and Computers since.
The thing I enjoy the most is the social interactions with friends, that might have not been so easy to visit or to be with in these times.
I tend to get too competitive when I play a Game for too long and I try to stop playing it before its not *FUN* anymore.
